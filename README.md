# marvelAppIonic

I have decided to do it using ionic due to 2 reasons:
1 - It is based on Angular, which is the framework we are going to use in the project
2 - It is a good hybrid technology to develop mobile apps like this

## Install

```
npm install -g ionic
npm install
```

## Execute

To run the project in the browser run:

```
ionic serve
```
